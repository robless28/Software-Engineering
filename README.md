Software Engineering Class Repo

Background: Social life app for thrift-type events. Typically, vendors or event organizers post on their social media, mainly Instagram, calling for vendors and announcing the event to the public (shoppers). This application would be a centralized app, where shops and the public can communicate about their similar interest. These types of events have garnered attention in the RGV, so as they grow in popularity, there should be a space to fulfill this community's needs. The goal is to make planning events easier and participation more convenient.
